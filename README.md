### VDC MQ

VDC MQ is (was) a rabbit MQ worker used to calcualate valorant statistics in a valorant league, due to lower than expected demand the system was never used in production and a site-based calculator was implemented.

The agent configs need to be updated if you plan on using this, hence the archiving.
I'd also recomend exporting the agent list to a JSON file, this was just a POC and was never retorfitted for prod.
